# Nashorn Anti Cheat

## Advanced client modpack integrity checker to fuck cheaters

## No more xenobytes from now!

### Client integrity is checked through validating hashes of client mods.  
### Validation logic is dispatched from server to prevent client from replaying the challenge.  
### Validation is performed through nashorn at client, and generated then obfuscated at server with nodejs.  
### Client script engine is restricted, so server cannot execute danger script on client.  
### This mod automaticlly deploy nodejs at server.   

### Supported platform:
#### JAVA 8(Hotspot) @ Windows/Linux @Minecraft 1.7.10
#### Only compatible with jvms with nashorn js engine.
